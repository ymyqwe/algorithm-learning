 * Testcase Example:  '22'
 *
 * Given a positiveÂ integer N, find and return the longest distance between two
 * consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N.
 *
 * If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0.

 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: 22
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * 22 in binary is 0b10110.
 * In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two
 * consecutive pairs of 1's.
 * The first consecutive pair of 1's have distance 2.
 * The second consecutive pair of 1's have distance 1.
 * The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * 5 in binary is 0b101.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: 6
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * 6 in binary is 0b110.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 *
 * Input: 8
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * 8 in binary is 0b1000.
 * There aren't any consecutive pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8,
 * so we return 0.
 *

 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 1 <= N <= 10^9
